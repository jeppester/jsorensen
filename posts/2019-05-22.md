# I made this site

My old site lasted nearly a decade, but truth be told, it was left outdated for way too long.

In an attempt to avoid such a fate for this new site, I'm trying something else: Rather than being a crappy half-clone of my linkedin profile, this new site will instead be a showroom for some of the side projects I'm working on.

A completely intended side effect is that I also get to treat my urge to share all these projects - even those unworthy of any attention.

I already have a small list of projects that I want to cover:

- My own project management system
- The probably not very inventive in-home open floor plan office L-shape wall
- How I'm hopefully solving the problem of daunting grocery shopping lists
- My android time tracker; Hours
- Home made TV furniture - and how a new TV almost ruined it
- More will follow

Since this is the first post about a thing I built; this website, here's a quick description of the technical side of things.

Everything is in git.
Post are written in markdown, each in it's own file.
A simple build process compiles the source files into a completely static website.

A hook ensures that every commit to the master branch will trigger my VPS to rebuild the site.

I'm hoping that this simple flow will allow me to focus on content rather than maintenance - time will tell if I'm right about that assumption.
