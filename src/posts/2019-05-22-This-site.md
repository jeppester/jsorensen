# I made this site

My old site lasted nearly a decade, but truth be told, it was left outdated for way too long.

In an attempt to avoid such a fate for this new site, I'm trying something else: Rather than being a crappy half-clone of my linkedin profile, this new site will instead be a show room for some of the side projects I'm working on.

A completely intended side effect is that I also get to treat my urge to share all these projects - even when they unworthy of any attention.

I already have a small list of projects that I want to cover, and hopefully more will follow:

- My own project management system
- The probably not very inventive in-home open floor plan office L-shape wall
- How I'm hopefully solving the problem of daunting grocery shopping lists
- My android time tracker; Hours
- Home made TV furniture - and how a new TV almost ruined it
